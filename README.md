Used dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/malicious-urls-dataset.

This project implements a comprehensive approach to detecting malicious URLs (harmful or harmless)
Starting with feature engineering and selection, the analysis progresses through implementing CNN and RNN architectures then comparing them against a BERT-based model. 
This implementation evaluates the effectiveness of these different approaches in identifying various types of malicious URLs (phishing, defacement, malware and benign).
